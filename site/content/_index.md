# Fresh Local Harvest

Weâ€™re building a community resource that makes it easier to discover **farmers markets, CSAs, and local food programs** across the United States.  

Our mission:  
- Keep market data accurate and up to date.  
- Highlight seasonal produce and programs like SNAP.  
- Provide a clear, searchable experience for anyone looking to connect with fresh food.  

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This project is actively being developed in the open. Things may look unfinished, and thatâ€™s intentional â€” we want to share the process transparently, including the challenges we face.  

ðŸ“– **Follow Along**  
Weâ€™re documenting progress and lessons learned on the [Blog](/blog). If youâ€™d like to see how a project like this comes together, check in there for updates.  
ðŸŒ± The **Map** feature (currently a dev preview) will soon let you explore markets interactively.
