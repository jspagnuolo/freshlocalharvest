We’re building a community resource that makes it easy to discover **farmers markets, CSAs, and local food programs** across the United States.

Our mission:
- Keep market data accurate and up to date  
- Highlight seasonal produce and programs like SNAP  
- Offer a clear, searchable experience for connecting with fresh, local food

**Work in Progress**  
We’re developing this in the open. Follow along as we ship features, fix issues, and share what we learn.
