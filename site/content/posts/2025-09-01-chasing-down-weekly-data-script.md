We blocked off a day to solve what seemed like a simple problem:  **“Let’s have our USDA data script run automatically once a week.”** Why, so we can ensure the data is always the most current and up-to-date.

How hard could that be? Turns out, it was one of those days where every step forward came with a detour.

---

## What We Tried
- **First attempt:** a quick `cron` job in our local environment.  
  Looked good on paper, but quickly ran into permission and path issues. Local dev ≠ production automation.
  
- **Second attempt:** wiring it into GitHub Actions.  
  We spent a while learning the right YAML incantations (`on: schedule:` syntax, `cron` expressions). It built, it triggered… but no data actually landed where we needed it.
  
- **Third attempt:** testing curl against the USDA endpoint directly.  
  The endpoint itself was flaky — sometimes timing out, sometimes throwing 500 errors. So we weren’t just fighting our own config; the data source wasn’t always cooperative.

- **Fourth attempt:** running the script manually on different hosts.  
  Locally, it worked fine. On GitHub, it worked *sometimes*. On our hosting environment, it stalled. We slowly realized this wasn’t a coding bug at all.

## What We Discovered
The “aha” moment came late in the day:  
- **The government’s SSL certificate was misconfigured.**  
  Our script was failing not because of our YAML or cron, but because the data server’s HTTPS handshake wasn’t valid. A certificate chain problem on *their* side was breaking automation on *our* side.

Manually, we could force-ignore the SSL check and pull the file. But for scheduled, unattended jobs, that’s not an ideal long-term fix. It left us in a strange spot: our code was fine, our automation was fine, but the official data source itself wasn’t fully reliable.

## How It Felt
It was one of those days where you drink more coffee than you planned and start questioning if you should’ve just gone to the farmers market with a clipboard instead. Every time we thought we nailed the problem, a new layer appeared. But we also walked away with some hard-earned knowledge:

- Automations are only as reliable as the weakest link — and sometimes that’s the data provider.  
- Debugging is often about ruling out what’s *not* broken.  
- And yes, even government servers forget to renew SSL certificates.

---

## Next Steps
- We’ll keep a manual override in place while we wait for the USDA team to sort out their SSL chain.  
- Meanwhile, we’ll explore caching strategies and maybe a mirror, so our app doesn’t choke when their server does.  
- And since we’ve already lived through one “all-day script debugging marathon,” we’ll write up the playbook so the next time it happens, we’re ready.

👉 Up next: we’re going to **refine our map interface**, bringing back search and filter features so people can actually find markets nearby (instead of just staring at pins). But that’s another story.
