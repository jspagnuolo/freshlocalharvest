Every good project needs a clean table to work on. For us, that meant one simple goal: **help people find real farmers markets quickly**â€”and build it in the open, one reversible step at a time.

We started by choosing a static site for speed, a tiny API for real questions (name, state, map area, distance), and a tidy data shape we can improve over time. Nothing fancy, just enough to move forward and learn in public.

Next up after kickoff: stand up the site, wire the blog, and start telling the story.
